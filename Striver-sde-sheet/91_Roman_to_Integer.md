# Roman to Integer

## Problem statement

Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: `I`, `V`, `X`, `L`, `C`, `D` and `M`.

```
Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000
```

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not `IIII`. Instead, the number four is written as `IV`. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as `IX`. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

- `I` can be placed before `V` (5) and `X` (10) to make 4 and 9.
- `X` can be placed before `L` (50) and `C` (100) to make 40 and 90.
- `C` can be placed before `D` (500) and `M` (1000) to make 400 and 900.

Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.

## Solution

Time complexity : O(N)  
Space complexity : O(1)

```cpp
int getInt(char ch) {
    switch(ch) {
        case 'I': return 1;
        case 'V': return 5;
        case 'X': return 10;
        case 'L': return 50;
        case 'C': return 100;
        case 'D': return 500;
        case 'M': return 1000;
    }
    return 0;
}
int romanToInt(string s) {
    int res = 0, last = 0;
    for(int i=s.size()-1; i>=0; i--) {
        int x = getInt(s[i]);
        if(x < last)
            res -= x;
        else
            res += x;
        last = x;
    }
    return res;
}
```
